I. About this Dataset

This dataset is an export from the Library of Congress By the People crowdsourcing program (https://crowd.loc.gov). It contains a combination of digital collections metadata, volunteer-created text generated through a transcription and review process, and metadata representing the arrangement of the items in the By the People platform, as defined by the Concordia (https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia) instance on which By the People operates. Concordia is an open source platform developed by the Library of Congress. Development is ongoing, iterative, and integrates user-centered design following the key principles of trust and approachability.

By the People invites anyone with an internet connection to contribute to the Library of Congress as virtual volunteers – transcribing and reviewing, and tagging historical texts to improve search and accessibility of Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created and reviewed by volunteers in a consensus model that requires at least 2 volunteers to complete a transcription. Volunteer-created transcriptions are published on the Library's website (https://www.loc.gov) alongside images of the original documents, to improve search and discovery of digital material, and improve access for people who use screen readers. 

The text available in this dataset is generated from the pages in the By the People Campaign, “Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words” (https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/). Rosa Parks is best known for one courageous act on one extraordinary day: she refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger on December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama. This decision launched the Montgomery Bus Boycott and a new phase of the civil rights movement. But it wasn’t the first time she stood up for herself and others, and it wasn’t the last. Hers was a life of activism and service. Transcriptions are available for letters to and from her mother, Leona McCauley; letters from her brother, Sylvester; and a poignant letter from her father, James. The largest group of her letters are to her husband, Raymond, in 1957 and 1958, when they had to live apart to find paying work. Raymond and Rosa Parks coped at a distance with the fallout from her bus protest and the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rosa’s letters are loving, compassionate, and nonjudgmental in the relationships that mattered most to her. Also included are transcriptions for fragmentary writings she created during and after the boycott.

Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words consists of 1769 images of digitized content from the Rosa Parks Papers collection (https://www.loc.gov/collections/rosa-parks-papers/about-this-collection/). The dataset includes transcriptions and data for these 1769 pages.  

II. What’s included?

This dataset includes:
-	2020445590.zip– zip file containing a CSV file and a README file
-	rosa-parks-in-her-own-words-2021-04-19.csv- a .CSV containing campaign, project, item, itemID, asset, and asset status metadata, as well as an image link, and the volunteer-generated transcription. This .CSV is the direct export of the Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words campaign.


III. How Was It Created?

These data were created by volunteers on the Library of Congress By the People program. By transcribing, reviewing, and tagging historical texts, virtual volunteers improve access to Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created by anonymous and registered volunteers. Registered volunteers can review the transcriptions created by other volunteers. At least one volunteer must accept a transcription as whole and accurate before it is marked complete. A transcription may undergo multiple rounds of edits before being completed. Once completed, transcriptions are incorporated into the Library's website.

The Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words data were created by 282 registered volunteers and an unknown number of anonymous users. The Library of Congress wishes to thank By the People volunteers for sharing their time and enthusiasm with us. The Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words campaign was fully transcribed and reviewed between February 4, 2020 and March 21, 2020

Following the completion of the entire campaign in the peer review process, By the People Community Managers exported a CSV of the campaign to create the file, rosa-parks-in-her-own-words-2021-04-19.csv.

Volunteers are instructed to transcribe the text as written, including misspellings or abbreviations. Formatting is generally not preserved with the exception of line breaks. Minimal markup does include “?” for illegible or unclear text, square brackets around deleted text, and square brackets and asterisks around marginalia ([*example*]).
