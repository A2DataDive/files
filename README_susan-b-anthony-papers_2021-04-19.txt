I. About this Dataset

This dataset is an export from the Library of Congress By the People crowdsourcing program (https://crowd.loc.gov). It contains a combination of digital collections metadata, volunteer-created text generated through a transcription and review process, and metadata representing the arrangement of the items in the By the People platform, as defined by the Concordia (https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia) instance on which By the People operates. Concordia is an open source platform developed by the Library of Congress. Development is ongoing, iterative, and integrates user-centered design following the key principles of trust and approachability.

By the People invites anyone with an internet connection to contribute to the Library of Congress as virtual volunteers – transcribing and reviewing, and tagging historical texts to improve search and accessibility of Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created and reviewed by volunteers in a consensus model that requires at least 2 volunteers to complete a transcription. Volunteer-created transcriptions are published on the Library's website (https://www.loc.gov) alongside images of the original documents, to improve search and discovery of digital material, and improve access for people who use screen readers. 

The text available in this dataset is generated from the pages in the By the People Campaign, “Susan B. Anthony Papers” (https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/susan-b-anthony-papers/). Susan B. Anthony’s papers span the period 1846-1934 and capture her interests in abolition and women's education, her campaign for women's property rights and suffrage in New York, and her work with the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). She and Elizabeth Cady Stanton founded the NWSA in 1869 when the suffrage movement split into two rival camps. The factions disagreed on whether to press for a federal women's suffrage amendment or to seek state-by-state enfranchisement. With the possible exception of her close collaborator Elizabeth Cady Stanton, no woman is more associated with the campaign for women's voting rights than Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906). Her name became so synonymous with suffrage that the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was called “the Anthony Amendment” for many years by its supporters. This campaign includes her letters, diaries, and speeches. 
Susan B. Anthony Papers consists of 5156 images of digitized content from the Susan B. Anthony Papers collection (https://www.loc.gov/collections/susan-b-anthony-papers/about-this-collection/). The dataset includes transcriptions and data for these 5156 pages.  

II. What’s included?

This dataset includes:
-	2020445591.zip– zip file containing a CSV file and a README file
-	susan-b-anthony-papers-2021-04-19.csv- a .CSV containing campaign, project, item, itemID, asset, and asset status metadata, as well as an image link, and the volunteer-generated transcription. This .CSV is the direct export of the Susan B. Anthony Papers campaign.


III. How Was It Created?

These data were created by volunteers on the Library of Congress By the People program. By transcribing, reviewing, and tagging historical texts, virtual volunteers improve access to Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created by anonymous and registered volunteers. Registered volunteers can review the transcriptions created by other volunteers. At least one volunteer must accept a transcription as whole and accurate before it is marked complete. A transcription may undergo multiple rounds of edits before being completed. Once completed, transcriptions are incorporated into the Library's website.

The Susan B. Anthony Papers data were created by 845 registered volunteers and an unknown number of anonymous users. The Library of Congress wishes to thank By the People volunteers for sharing their time and enthusiasm with us. The Susan B. Anthony Papers campaign was fully transcribed and reviewed between June 3, 2019 and May 11, 2020.

Following the completion of the entire campaign in the peer review process, By the People Community Managers exported a CSV of the campaign to create the file, susan-b-anthony-papers-2021-04-19.csv.

Volunteers are instructed to transcribe the text as written, including misspellings or abbreviations. Formatting is generally not preserved with the exception of line breaks. Minimal markup does include “?” for illegible or unclear text, square brackets around deleted text, and square brackets and asterisks around marginalia ([*example*]).
