I. About this Dataset

This dataset is an export from the Library of Congress By the People crowdsourcing program (https://crowd.loc.gov). It contains a combination of digital collections metadata, volunteer-created text generated through a transcription and review process, and metadata representing the arrangement of the items in the By the People platform, as defined by the Concordia (https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia) instance on which By the People operates. Concordia is an open source platform developed by the Library of Congress. Development is ongoing, iterative, and integrates user-centered design following the key principles of trust and approachability.

By the People invites anyone with an internet connection to contribute to the Library of Congress as virtual volunteers – transcribing and reviewing, and tagging historical texts to improve search and accessibility of Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created and reviewed by volunteers in a consensus model that requires at least 2 volunteers to complete a transcription. Volunteer-created transcriptions are published on the Library's website (https://www.loc.gov) alongside images of the original documents, to improve search and discovery of digital material, and improve access for people who use screen readers. 

The text available in this dataset is generated from the pages in the By the People Campaign, “Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers” (https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/elizabeth-cady-stanton-papers/). Suffrage was an important but not singular goal for Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902). Since childhood, she rebelled against the role assigned to women and chafed at being denied a university education because of her gender. As a young woman, she became involved in the temperance and antislavery movements, through which she met abolitionist reformer and journalist Henry Brewster Stanton (1805-1887). They married in May 1840. While honeymooning in England, Stanton became outraged when she and other women were barred from a major antislavery convention. The incident spurred her and Lucretia Mott (1793-1880), a Quaker minister from Pennsylvania and one of the American delegates to the London meeting, to organize a women’s rights convention. The event took place in July 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York and is considered by many as the beginning of the American woman suffrage movement. There Stanton put forth her daring Declaration of Sentiments, including the then-radical demand for women's voting rights, a goal that would consume the women's movement for more than seventy years. This campaign includes Stanton’s correspondence, speeches, and other writings. 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers consists of 3456 images of digitized content from the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers collection (https://www.loc.gov/collections/elizabeth-cady-stanton-papers/about-this-collection/). The dataset includes transcriptions and data for these 3456 pages.  

II. What’s included?

This dataset includes:
-	2020445592.zip– zip file containing a CSV file and a README file
-	elizabeth-cady-stanton-papers-2021-04-19.csv- a .CSV containing campaign, project, item, itemID, asset, and asset status metadata, as well as an image link, and the volunteer-generated transcription. This .CSV is the direct export of the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers campaign.


III. How Was It Created?

These data were created by volunteers on the Library of Congress By the People program. By transcribing, reviewing, and tagging historical texts, virtual volunteers improve access to Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created by anonymous and registered volunteers. Registered volunteers can review the transcriptions created by other volunteers. At least one volunteer must accept a transcription as whole and accurate before it is marked complete. A transcription may undergo multiple rounds of edits before being completed. Once completed, transcriptions are incorporated into the Library's website.

The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers data were created by 656 registered volunteers and an unknown number of anonymous users. The Library of Congress wishes to thank By the People volunteers for sharing their time and enthusiasm with us. The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Papers campaign was fully transcribed and reviewed between June 4, 2019 and June 15. 2020.

Following the completion of the entire campaign in the peer review process, By the People Community Managers exported a CSV of the campaign to create the file, elizabeth-cady-stanton-papers-2021-04-19.csv.

Volunteers are instructed to transcribe the text as written, including misspellings or abbreviations. Formatting is generally not preserved with the exception of line breaks. Minimal markup does include “?” for illegible or unclear text, square brackets around deleted text, and square brackets and asterisks around marginalia ([*example*]).
