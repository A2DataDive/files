Everything he does while pitching is of tremendous importance to him. That is good enough to be complimentary about if, indeed, he were able to relax, - let down we call it, while he is pitching. He is so extremely conscientious about his work and, of course, that makes him wild.    He has a world of stuff. Indeed, he has the basic foundation of four distinctive pitches, - great speed when he wants it, corking curve, and both changes. Big, strong, fine in every way. It seems to me that he might be a right handed Hallahan, - all a matter of control.    I am not so sure that talking about his lack of control so much and the other emphasis we have put on it and the number of times and the number of people who have probably talked to him about it has made him subconscious of his lack of control, and everytime he winds up to throw a ball, he is thinking about method or means, - in any event his lack of control and that pressure which has been put upon him has not helped him and probably has retarded his naturalness in delivery and hindered his acquiring of better control. He is the type of boy who worries about his work, thinks about it, somehow or other. We have to get him out of that frame of mind. Whenever he gets control, he is a quicky."

Fair fast ball, curve very medium speed, but it curves; has more the effect of a change of speed curve ball. Has about that velocity that makes it difficult to make it a faster or slower one. He worked on a change of speed off his fast ball with some success, - not much. He is a good boy and I mean good. If all our eighteen year old boys in America were like this chap, most certainly God would smile upon us as a nation. He cannot pitch, however, right now. Any slight criticism immediately dampens him. Failure in any respect would make him dejected. He would get discouraged easily in would seem to me. He can be pleasant, but his self-appraisement of failure would make him possibly even disagreeable. Right now he is a good boy in every way."

He showed no power at the plate tonight, but I do not see any reason why this boy should not hit the ball hard. I would say that he can run, - above average. Showed no lead, and gave no evidence of gambling on a break. Played first base, and at least showed one fine skill,-on a throw from the catcher, he tags to his right, and seems to do the scissors with his right leg naturally. I have yet to see Kiner take a throw and tag to his right at anytime.    Bevan did not tag to the ground, but did tag six to eight inches high on several occasions. In this respect he has about two feet on Kiner. His foot shifting was beyond critcism in this game. He touches with both the left and right foot as the play may require. This also is a point entirely beyond Kiner who has never yet been known to touch the base with his left foot. Bevan might become a first baseman. I do not know. I would like to see him at some other infield position, - not because I do not think he can ultimately play first base, but simply because we have pro-  spective first basemen in the organization, - boys who ought to do the job. He looks and acts like a good athelete."

He could go major league. I doubt if he ever will, and because of only one reason, and that is because he has no adventure. Takes a six foot lead off first base and doesn't even dare the pitcher with that lead. As far as leads and breaks are concerned, he would do just as well as if he were the slowest runner in the world. It is just too bad that a fellow with his physical set-up should be without any dare whatever. This boy should become a good hitter. When Bevan gets on first base, he says to himself, - ""I must not get caught off"". He never says to himself, - ""I challenge you."" He never produces a thought in the pitcher's mind, or the catcher's mind, or anyone's mind that he is liable to run. He seldom will arrive at second base in time to take a man out on a possible double play.    I doubt if he is a second baseman."

He has no control of it whatever. He throws a curve ball and it is easily his best pitch. In fact, the ball curves. A windmill delivery on it from a 6' 4"" fellow helps it out, BUT he has no control whatever of it either.     He is honest. Said his control at Modesto was ""positively terrible."" I asked about his control at Eugene, where he spent the latter part of the season. Branch said it was even worse than at Modesto. He has no ability to learn the change of pace on his fast ball. the ball almost never spins. It just rolls around. He is willing and it is just too bad. He needs a better teacher than I am. He is intelligent, that is to say, he knows what he needs and understands that some of his pitches are bad and some are good. He is understanding. Hate to give up on him. There isn't any point in changing the speed on his curve. His present curve is neither fast or slow, but is good, but is of that velocity that it will be difficult to get a change-up on it either faster or slower. It is the only curve ball he needs or should have.     Even if this boy has control of his present curve and fast ball, he must have an additional and distinctively different pitch and, it must be usable. There is a job ahead of him to become a major league pitcher, - a hard job, but he might do it. We really must work on him."

His right thumb protrudes above the ball on his curve noticeably. In other words, the ball is back in the sock on the curve ball much more than on his fast ball. I do not believe the difference is enough to try to change him. I doubt if a coach or batsman will detect it, but it must have further attention.    His fast ball is good and his overhand curve is good. He also throws a sidearm curve and in the seven times he threw it, not one was over the plate. His change of speed on the fast ball is a ""palm"" ball. I do not like it. It is too fast for one thing. He must get a change-up on his fast ball. His change-up on his curve ball might be alright. I need to work on him again. I was rushed for time. I would say that he has to be improved in that respect also. He comes to a quick fielding position. I believe he has general athletic ability. He looks the part anyway. He is certainly worth a lot of attention in this camp.    October 5, 1951  This boy does not have control of his change of pace, and in fact he doesn't have a change-up on his curve ball. He says he threw one all summer, but he isn't throwing it now because of a sore elbow. Before he pitches in camp, I want the managers to have a conversation with him about this."

No curve, no change of pace on either his fast or curve balls, but his control, size, youth, and desire make him worthwhile of our attention. The decision to make a pitcher out of this boy is undoubtedly a good one. These boys will work together at the present time under Rex Bowen. If Rex gets anywhere with his job, these boys would then be turned over to Bill Burwell with the purpose of each one getting a better breaking regular curve ball.     Kaffel"

He should be assigned for regular work to Bill Burwell or Barrett or any coach who is full of suggestions. This boy is more of the Law type in the field of intelligence. Has the marks of culture about him, courtesy and manners, and all that. He can get out of the thrower class very fast and become a pitcher. He simply needs more material. He requires mechanical attention and help. I would call him a definite prospect, - that he will come as fast as his variables permit. I like him."

If this boy has any command of himself, has poise, competitive spirit, etc., etc., he will certainly amount to something. You do not have to fool around for four or five years with Anderson. His chrysalis stage is soon over. I see no reason why he cannot go to AAA next year. Everything depends upon stage fright, or possibly give-up-ness.

Do not worry about his delivery. He will be the same on all pitches. He needs continuous attention, not because of his faults on points such as holding men on base or fielding his position but to obtain perfection on pitches and control. He might be perfect, and it is worth the effort of all of us to make him so. The same thing goes for Neccai and a dozen others, but certainly it goes for Kline.    This boy should team up with Bert Haysom. They both have identical needs, although Haysom is not yet in a class with Kline."

Great things were expected of him for 1951. He roomed with Chambers; that was bad. He has been a constant complainer that his arm was ""ailing"" and has been of very little service or help to our club this year. He is the greatest single disappointment I have had. Law has the reputation of a great fast ball. I have not seen it and he is supposed to have a repertoire of pitches, adequate and effective. I have not seen the repertoire. He is about six feet four and can run very fast, and has considerable power at the plate. He is going to Florida both as a pitcher and a possible outfielder. He will either be an improved pitcher and what was expected of him or he will be an outfielder or he won't be worth very much, - one of the three, and the October school in Florida will tell the tale.    This player's salary was advanced from $5,000 to $10,000 in 1951 without good reason. In fact, the only reason was Senator Walker of Idaho through whom Pittsburgh first secured the player. His salary should be reduced back to $5,000 for'52, but it may be unadvisable because of Senator Walker and particularly Bing Crosby whose final effort secured the player. I gave the Senator all the reasons why this chap should not be advanced in salary to $10,000 and I believe if he had been signed as he should have been signed, we would have had a different player out of him.    I have great hope of doing something good for Law in Florida. He is the championship type, loves to play, fine general ability as an athlete and a genuine gentleman in every respect.    Branch Rickey  BR/emm"

Good fast ball, good curve, good change of pace curve, and he has a change of pace on his fast ball which Bill Posedel gave him. It has a wiggle-waggle rotation, - a sort of half fadeway rotation, but it definitely is not a fadeway. The only effect I see in his change-up on the fast ball is in its velocity. It has no spin and no correct rotation according to my way of thinking. The velocity is reduced over his fast ball, but again, in my opinion, - not enough. He took the conventional change up on the fast ball quickly as to spin and as to direction of the spin. Had some trouble reducing velocity, but once out of every four or five pitches, he would get a beautiful change of pace, - and he knew it.    He can pitch on our Club alright and he can pitch his present change of speed, but I do not think anywhere near as effective as it should be. And I thoroughly believe that with some practice on the conventional changeup on the fast ball he will be much more effective. If he had the same fast ball change-up, for example, that Erskine has, Law would probably be a twenty game winner. He understands it, and if he returns to pitching, and he probably will, he can easily acquire proficiency in this new pitch before the opening of next season. He certainly is an intelligent gentleman, and a fine character."

He also can throw a slow curve ball and with fairly good control, but not good enough. This boy, also like Wolfe and others, is out of the major league because, first, he doesn't have usable pitches, i.e., he doesn't have control. Ronny has four distinct pitches and each of them from practically any angle of delivery. He is without a doubt a great prospect. No further away from helping the Pittsburgh Club than simply control.

He is not only intelligent, but he is a very nice chap. He is full of ideas and might become someday a tricky, clever, shrewdly clever, artistic pitcher.

He showed slow reactions, both mentally and physically, I thought. Later and during the summer from conversations and reports, I believed him to be embryonic neurotic, due, I believed, to a satisfying financial status and a fear that he might hurt his arm if he threw hard. Managers and scouts and myself began to work on this boy, in an effort to have him understand that he had to go to work.    Following another dreary season, he reported to Pittsburgh at the close of the South Atlantic League season, and I have worked with him three times, the last two at his request. Everyone notes a change of attitude; he is seeking help. Yesterday when I worked him out, at the finish he said, ""I thank you, Mr. Rickey, very much."" That was a new day.    Undoubtedly, this boy originally had a fast ball. We have fifteen young pitchers with more speed than Pettit - I have counted them up - men I have personally worked with during this present year. He doesn't have a great curve; in fact, it is a very poor curve. His aptitude is just above average, but, as indicated, his willingness right now is great.    Pettit is a big boy, still very young and surely as physically sound as any youngster can be. It is my judgment that he is still subject to silly response, to trivial ailments or injuries. It may be that with him a bruise or abrasion is at once tragic. Most certainly, he is a better prospect now than he has been at any previous time. That is not saying very much. We still owe him $40,000 in eight annual payments of $5,000 each and he is working under an original contract, expiring at the close of 1952 at a salary of $6,000. The general charge against him is that he will not throw hard. He is saturated with fear a complex. That, I say, is the impression of everybody who has anything to do with him. It may have been a fully correct impression but I believe we are in front of a change, as I have stated above.    At the present time, he is not worth holding on our roster. We have Major League waivers on his contract. He could be placed at Hollywood, subject to draft at $10,000. Under all the circumstances, I think we have to hold him another year, although he presses our player limit, most unfortunately.    I have given him a new rotation on his fast ball and he has acquired, since coming to Pittsburgh this fall, a new change-up speed curve ball, and he has control of it. I see no reason for taking him to Florida to the fall school but he must have personal attention in spring training.    Branch Rickey"

Also throws overhand curve ball pretty good, at least better than the other one. Can learn to throw change of speed off his fast ball and should be paired with someone working on the two changes.

BRANCH RICKEY ON NEW ORLEANS CLUB AS OBSERVED IN ONE GAME AT MEMPHIS ON MAY 29, 1951.    THOMAS    This chap either cannot throw or does not know how, or both. He simply throws for distance and apparently does not have the arm for it, and in this game he showed aboriginal stupidity. His playing of the fly ball, also in his timing of getting to the ground ball, also in his playing and retrieving of a rebound from the fence.    Surely he can hit, - and with power. His batting form is superb. I do not believe any criticism can be made of his poise, or his stride, or his stance, or sweep of the bat. He should hit any kind of a pitch and for almost any distance. His running would not keep him out of the big leagues. His power will carry him a long ways. In fielding he times both fly balls and ground balls. Whether or not he can overcome the bad points in fielding, particularly his arm, I do not know. He should be talked to in detail about his weaknesses.    I met him outside my office door and talked to him this last winter for a minute or two. It is my judgment that he has very little of what is known as common sense."

Perfect form at the plate, and a lot of power. Should be able to hit any kind of pitching. Both Joe Brown and Rip Sewell tell me he is a good fellow on the club, - a team player, wants to win. Runs in and out from his position all the time, and his interest is just not put on. I think he really means it. I have never seen him throw the ball low enough to any base or the home plate. He is an ""Andy Over"" thrower, yet his arm is strong. If he would throw the ball down, he might then be accurate with it. Sewell says he is accurate, but he has never shown accuracy to me. He is a distance thrower. Can run good enough, and he never loafs. I like his potentialities.     He, too, is not daring. He assumes, for example, that the outfielder is going to get the ball, and he doesn't overrun the base as far as he should. There are a lot of things he doesn't know. He could stand a lot of correct coaching; illustration: When running off third base with a runner on first, - every time the pitcher threw to first, he started back to third. He should, with great daring, start for home. If a wild throw is made to first, or missed, he could easily score, but he is back on the bag. In other words, he moves exactly in the wrong direction on this play. He shifts very short distances on the different batters. This may be due first to lack of knowledge of hitters, or, second, it can be that the opposing team, in the few games that I have observed, all hit to the same spot.    ""Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth."", and great players whom management would like to see in Pittsburgh are to be found fault with if they are not as good as they should be.     And, finally, one more possible criticism. With the score nothing to nothing, and a runner in scoring distance, he fails to take a chance. On a short fly ball that he could have caught, I am sure, if he had made a dive, he failed to do so. He, too, may not have championship adventure in his soul. I do not know about it.    If this team had a couple of ace pitchers, they could make a big stir in the Southern League race, and easily go into the play-offs, and that is my fault. I want everybody to do their best to help me find these pitchers.    BRANCH RICKEY"

He uses a three-finger knuckle ball for a change of speed off his fast ball, and he has suprising con-trol of the pitch. Doubtless, he would be a great high school pitcher and he could make good in a fairly good league immediately, unless, indeed, he is subject to stage fright in some form or the other. I would not hes-itate to send him to Waco or Burlington immediately. He is barely 18 and without a doubt has a fine future. He too is intelligent, calm, composed, deliberate, calculating.

Big right hander, 18, say 190 or thereavouts. About 6'2"". Is a boy. Fast ball straight as a string, but he has good control of it and it isn't a bad fast ball. It has above average velocity. His curve ball is a 'darb' and he has good control of that. He has a slow curve, throws it readily. It curves straight down, and he has decent control of that, too.  He has no change up on his fast ball. He acquired it as to direction of spin and rapidity of spin, but did not acquire regularity in the velocity of it. About half the time it had the right speed. He will get it, however.  Quick mind. Affable. Nice boy. Not a dummy. If he didn't make good grades in high school it would be simply because he didn't give a darn. His father and mother and grandparents on both sides were smart enough. He is the sort of fellow who is looking for new worlds to conquer. ""Show me some-thing else you want me to do"", is his continuous slogan. I like him. He is worthwhile as a pitcher. He would need to be sent to a careful manager. He could become a ladies man or a good drinker. He could go a long way in the professional game. He is worth a bonus, I wish we could sign him decently.   This is a fellow that I think everybody would like personally. If he would run for political office, he would be a tough bird to beat. He would be elected by acclamation, and it could be true that he would be qualified for any job that he himself believed he could do.  ADDITIONAL FOR WILLIS Very good speed and his curve ball breaks. I see no reason why he should not have good control. He is really relaxed. Nothing tense about him out there and he is as loose as three gooses. I like him very much. If he had changes he might be a tough boy to beat. Shows no sign of excitement or pressure. I could easily see this boy in the Majors some day. I would try to sign him right now and I wish I had the chance to work him out. I would not be surprised if this fellow is good all-round athlete. I would like to find out about him."

This chap has a fast ball and a darn good one, and it does something. It has a tendency to ""shoot"". Strong, fast, and repeating in delivery.     The curve ball ain't.

With control, this ball is useable. He has worked on the conventional change-up on his fast ball given to him by George Sisler on the occasion of his first visit to Pittsburgh sometime ago. It is useable but not at all what one would hope for. He told me he was 21 years of age. He really looks older.     I would not be surprised to find out later that he is opinionated.

Change of speed on curve ball not good enough for use, but this pitch, - also his curve ball, normally throws him out of pitching position so far as fielding is concerned. Also, when he bears down on his fast ball, his body position is almost in reverse. Needs a lot of work on learning to field but no manager should insist on changing his delivery in order to increase his fielding ability. He must first pitch. Then he will require some work under the right kind of supervision. The boy is agile enough.

Fine person, - a gentleman. Comes from a very poor family. He is the chief support. Father is a coal miner and in bad health, etc.    This boy is supposed to have a very fine fast ball. He didn't show it to me. It is what I would call a good fast ball without any deviation whatever, and I know of no reason why he should not have good control of this pitch. He has a good curve ball at times, - not all the time. He must become regular with a good curve.    He has a slow curve and identically the same thing can be said about it as I have said about the fast curve.    He has a change-up on the fast ball which does change-up, and the spin is rapid and fairly good direction, but it is too fast. He must take something off of it before it is to be made a perfect change-up. He should become a major league pitcher. I doubt if he is ready right now.    This boy has a grievous fault. In all windup pitches there is a slow movement of his pitching hand just after the right hand leaves the glove for 8"" to 10"" he goes very slow with his hands and runners can easily take advantage of it. Now this fault is really not a fault on his windup delivery but he holds the same movement with men on bases, and then the movement becomes most regrettable. This slow right hand movement is a habit and will be very difficult indeed for him to correct. He is sensible to the fault and he may be able with close attention to correct it. I doubt if the boy ever has greatness in front of him.    The reason I sent for him for this workout was to help me determine whether or not to bring him up to our club at this time and protect him from the draft. His recrod [record] in 1953 at New Orleans was nil because of a broken foot. This injury bothered him more or less during the first half of the season and probably had some effect mentally throughout the year. His work with the Longview club was so so and with Charleston the same. He had some very good games. He is the sort of chap that everyone who knows him would wish to be successful. He deserves our attention and help and he will get it. I think I will bring him up.    BRANCH RICKEY"

I have given him some suggestions that might be helpful in bringing his slow curve delivery to the same effort he employs in his other pitches.    This boy has a chance because of his aptitude and desire.

I also told the boy that you would  reimburse him for his transportation and living expenses and any other expenses  involved in making the trip from Detroit to Pittsburgh.    This young man worked with us last year and looked like a very fine prospect,  George, and I am quite anxious that you and Mr. Rickey have a good chance to see  him.

He throws a change-up on his fast ball and it does have less velocity, but it is too fast. He can get a slower ball on his fast change-up. If he will work on it, he will get control of it. Then, he will become quite a pitcher. He has a good pitching attitude and good pitching intelligence.    His father and mother drink some and he drinks and he has the apparent virility of a stud horse. He will be bigger and his big enough right now. Beyond any doubt he is quite a prospect. I shall not be surprised if he can pitch splendidly for New Orleans next year. I think so.    His hand is wide but he has short fingers. I will say with positiveness that I have never seen a pitcher with so short fingers who had so great control.    He has the reputation of being a little wild at night. No boy 18 years of age such as Roger is ever a bad boy. He can be salvaged completely, and Branch, Jr. is the fellow who can do it. He must be given very close attention off the field as well as on it. He can become a technically good pitcher and we must see to it that he becomes a technically fine gentleman.     I can easily see him in a World Series in Pittsburgh.    BRANCH RICKEY    I can easily see him in a World Series in Pittsburgh.    Branch Rickey"

Mother and guardian Mrs. Dawes. Has one older brother in the  army. Lives in Chelsea, Oklahoma. Good American Legion record, good  high school and semi-pro record.      In the graduating class of 1954, Ralph was number three/and/is  attending a branch of Oklahoma A. & M. at Miami, Oklahoma.      A good boy, good background, good habits, 12 letter man in high  school, interested in his school work and in his athletics to the  complete exclusion, I would say, of women. Intelligent face, fine manner,  understands my baseball conversation.      Aptitude fair to good. Will have trouble getting correct spinning  direction on all new pitches. Needs a lot of work but he knows how to  apply himself. He might acquire any new pitch because of his application.  For example, he would have considerable difficulty acquiring regular or  repeating direction to his spin on the so-called thumb slow curve ball.  He gets it on occasion, therefore, he can get it on all occasions. It is  doubtful if he needs this pitch for he has a slow curve ball distinctive  enough from his regular curve. He lacks useable control of the pitch,  however.      His fast ball is good enough, not great, but good, and his control  of it is indeed unusually good. He had difficulty also in spinning  direction on his change-up fast ball.      His regular curve breaks at times beautifully. However, lacks  consistency and when he presses on his pitch, he is wild with it.      The greatest reason for saying that this boy has a chance to go all  the way is, first, his size, body control, regularity in delivery, fast  ball control and above all his desire. If he were in the hands of  Kinnamon or Bragen, it is possible to show enough improvement in  one year to be generally rated as a prospect. In my book, he has a chance.      He needs attention on pitching skills, and lots of work. He should  not be placed anywhere that he would be benched; unless indeed he were  to be a bonus player, in which case he must close attention from a  special coach. His tendencies are in the way of a pitcher not a thrower.      I did not try him with men on bases. He might show similarly  bad form and inexperience in this department, but I think he would be  easily teachable.      He does not follow his pitch, evidently he has never been  coached on the point. There is a complete regularity and repeat in the  stepping position of his left foot, also the right one. I am very sure he would  acquire a follow-up movement of the left foot easily and quickly.      His fingering is good on all pitches. There is no variation in the  thumb position, nor in the split between the fingers nor the placement"

Then, too, it may  be that he needs dependable poise. It can be true that he  gets nervous and wild under pressure. Most youngsters do.  He is now 20 and he has sufficient intelligence to come  fast. He must devote himself to spot pitching as I have   explained in my comments to Don Dangleis.    Green has been assigned to go with Dangleis to the  spot pitching target and he has been told not to bear down  until his instructions are changed. He has been admonished  very strongly to come to a fielding position quickly. His  present habit, in my judgment, doesn't bring him to a quick  fielding position. That he must practice in this spot pitching   period.    BRANCH RICKEY    BR/b"

Why he would be in the majors for six years and be regarded as a minor leaguer in the majors is not easy understandable. He doesn't have a GREAT fast ball. However, it is good enough. He has a fast curve that curves, not great, but good enough. He has no change-up whatever on his fast ball. That COULD be one explanation. He has a slow curve. It is a/really very good slow curve, - useable and all that, - useable if indeed he had good control of it.     The reason he is waived out of the league is due to the fact that he doesn't have a high-class extra pitch. He can get it and he will get if if he applies himself. He should to to the spot pitching mound, and work on control of his slow curve and really master some kind of a change on his fast ball.

In other words, he has varying velocities simply  because of effort. If the ball has a great deal of   velocity, it has a tendency to 'slide'. If he takes something   off of the effort, thus reducing the velocity, the ball then  dips or sinks and does it with great regularity. He has found  these variations in speeds and deflection to be the result of  nothing more than effort. He retains the same fingering,  the same delivery, and practically throws no curves and no   so-called changes on either the fast ball or the curve.  A very unusual pitching procedure indeed.    Bob has no curve, - nothing to speak of.

He has control of it.    His delivery on his regular stuff is very different from his delivery on his change-ups. In other words, he tips off the changes. The movement becomes slow at the finish.     In the olden days, you would not give the boy anything but a chance in a small league. Today you may have to pay him $500 for the chance. If he can get more money somewhere else, I would encourage him to take it.    His age and size and very unusual control make him a possibility for the majors.    BRANCH RICKEY"

Every body muscle is under control. He could play shortstop and certainly would be a corking second baseman. Indeed, I think Boyer could play anywhere and I mean ANYWHERE. His position at the plate is not exactly orthodox, but the movement of his left leg (he is a right hand hitter) enables him to time the pitch. It is not an exaggerated hoisting of the leg like Ott, but there is enough pause in the lift to enable him to adjust himself to the change of speed pitching. He may have some weakness at the plate, but he should not have any and eventually he will not any. He drives the ball with great power, and he is not a fly ball hitter.

If I were the owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, this is the time where I would again offer $400,000 for a great pitcher as I did at a certain time when I had the Brooklyn club.

Bragan has never communicated directly or indirectly this year with President Sanguily, nor with anyone else. I told Dr. Sanguily in 12 years relationship with Bragan, having made him manager at Fort Worth and then at Hollywood, that never one single time has he ever written me a letter on any subject whatever or voluntarily offered information about his own players or players on other clubs or free agents. Dr. Sanguily told me that he thought Bragan was disappointed because he had not been given heretofore the Pittsburgh job; that Bragan had expressed himself as determined to quit if he stayed in the minors more than another year. Doubtless Bobby has heard rumors about being considered by Roy Hamey and these rumors may have been highly exaggerated.    He is certainly an entirely different person off the field than on it. His clowning, buffoonery, and physical indulgence in ridicule cause much comment hereabouts. None of this shows up at all except when he is in uniform. He is full of decision, deliberate and instant in action., and every detail of his work is important. He handles men, is solicitous about their welfare and health, associates socially and closely too with the players and their families, and yet maintains a strict discipline and holds the respect of every player. As a tactician, he is sound, with enough daring to make his management unpredictable. He is no respector of persons, - Hornsbyesque in no respect for persons. They are all on the same level with Bragan, and that's something. He has management ability of baseball players and of the game itself that very few major league managers have. Fred Haney, a grand character, - the best, - is the first reader compared with this post graduate in the field of command and procedure.

In the second place, every delivery regardless of the call of the pitch repeats. He is completely finished in deliveries.  He must be placed on the target. I don't think he needs another pitch.

I have been told very often from many sources about his running speed. I was sorely disappointed with it. His running form is bad, definitely bad, and based upon what I saw tonight, he has only a bit above average major league running speed. He has a beautiful throwing arm. He throws the ball down and it really goes places. However, he runs with the ball every time he makes a throw and that's bad.    He has no adventure whatever on the bases, takes a comparatively small lead, and doesn't have in mind, apparently, getting a break. I can imagine that he has never stolen a base in his life with his skill or cleverness. I can that it if was done it was because he was pushed off.    His form at the plate is perfect. The bat is out and back and in good position to give him power. There is not the slightest hitch of movement in his hands or arms and the big end of the bat is completely quiet when the ball leaves the pitcher???????s hand. His sweep is level - very level. His stride is short and his stance is good to start with and he finishes good with his body. I know of no reason why he should not become a very fine hitter. I would not class him, however, as even a prospective home run hitter.    I do not believe he can possibly do a major league club any good in 1955. It is just too bad that he could not have had his first year in a Class B or C league and then this year he might have profited greatly with a second year as a regular say in Class A. In 1956 he can be sent out on option by Pittsburgh only by first securing waivers, and waivers likely cannot be secured. So, we are stuck with him, - stuck indeed, until such time as he can really help a major league club.    The most disappointing feature about CLEMENTE is his lack of adventure, - of chance taking. He had at least two chances tonight to make a good play. He simply waited for the bounce. I hope he looks better to me tomorrow night when Santurce plays San Juan, - the final game of the regular season and the city championship of San Juan is at stake. Perhaps this boy will put out in that game."

Donoso can throw both his curve  and fast ball side arm, and he should have sense enough to do  it on occasion. He will throw the side arm pitch in warming  up before the game, but when the game starts, quite evidently   he never thinks of it.     A 2 and 2 pitch to Gonzales in the 8th inning was the second time  he threw the knuckle ball in this game.     [Handwritten] Donoso advised Monchy this pitch was not  a knuckle ball but a curve.   He only threw one the entire game."

In 1950 he was with the Yankees and pitched for Newark, Ohio, winning 14 and losing 1. In 1951, the Yankees offered him $200 per month salary and he quit, and didn't play that entire season. In 1952 he joined the Quincy club and I believe finished that year with Palm Beach. His record was fairly good in both places and while at Palm Beach he was drafted into the army. He returned to the Yankee organization this past spring of '55 from the army and was sent to Winston-Salem. He was in good shape. For the first three weeks of the season he was not given a single starting assignment. The Yankees said he was washed up and assigned his contract outright to Grand Forks. The player was very unhappy with his alleged treatment and quit the Grand Forks club and stated he had an ailing arm. Various things happened and at the end of three weeks in Grand Forks he was given his unconditional release. Immediately his arm was fully recovered and he told Dick Fischer that he was in great shape and ready to go to town and wanted a bonus for signing. Dick Fischer evidently believes in this fellow and sent him to Pittsburgh for me to look over. I did. The player has an ordinary fast ball but good control of it. He throws what he calls a spinner, which is another name for the modern new-fangled pitch generally called a slider. It slides. I don't believe in the pitch at all.     Tom's curve ball is just so so. Fair speed on it and it does break, - not a great deal, but it breaks. He has good control of the curve. He throws a change-up on his fast ball but he tips it off plenty. He throws it with a complete give-away motion. If this pitcher were able to acquire a knuckle ball, a usable knuckle ball, he might go places. He seems to have composure and I would say a very acceptable pitching disposition. He wants $1000 bonus to sign.    I told him I would give him a job at Burlington with a Class B salary and no bonus. He was quite disappointed and felt that if he could not get $1000 to sign a contract, then he would go into something else.

Sukey called it a 'slider' and told me that it was an 'intentional slider'. He through a change-up curve ball which was good enough and his change up on the fast ball may be good if he can get it somewhere near the plate.    This fellow, at sometime or other in his early life, or perhaps when he was in grade school, hit some kid somewhere or other and hurt him, - and all through his adolescence and through his college course and up to now he has had the idea and undoubtedly still has it that the plate is an imaginary floating jumping jack located somewhere away from the batter. In 19 straight fast ball pitches, only one was a strike, the other eighteen were outside and away from the batter, - whether the batter was a left hander or a right hander, it made no difference. He shows signs of being definitely afraid to pitch inside to any batsman. How long it will take to get out of his head the fact that plate is located very close to the batter and that some of the batters are even as close to the plate as 6"", I don't know. But I do know that he has to come to the facts of life.    It would be very surprising thing to me if this boy could win right now in Class B. However, he couldn't win there if the batters would simply take pitches and not swing on the bad ones. He would be a very much better pitcher in our league at the present time if he never threw a single fast ball, - not one. It serves only to put him in the hole.    He comes definitely set on all pitches with men on bases. He could very easily vary this position. He conforms strictly to the balk rule and that is good and proper. However, the balk rule is not enforced anywhere, and this boy must come to pitch with some regularity without coming to the stop. The last three or found inches of his movement before he comes ""to set"" are made very slowly and he could pitch off this slow movement and tie up every runner."

Nearly always it is thrown side arm or rather it has a side arm pitch effect. To a right hander, it should be, and I think is, an effective screw ball. This change up in itself is quite a pitch. Apparently he is afraid to pitch it over the plate. And also, apparently, he thinks the pitch should be above the waistline rather than below it. If Pitts would get his change up on the fat ball into the strike zone and then pitch it oftener, he can go places.    I like Pitts. I think he has a good chance. His fast ball is good enough and his curve ball is good.    SECOND FAULT  Whenever Pitts gets behind the hitter or in trouble for any reasons, HE presses, - more obviously than any young pitcher I can now think of. He throws his fast ball with extra effort and then he really is wild, i.e., wild for Pitts. Instead of him becoming a thinker, and clever, and resourceful, and trying to mentally out-maneuver the batsman, he resorts to force. he thinks, ""now I have got to over-power him.""

He   will hit at bad balls. He is extremely anxious to hit   and with two strikes on him, it has always been true that   he will hit bad pitches.

C.  July 20, 1955    SCHULTZ, DON    Right hand pitcher. I like him, but it must certainly be that he  doesn't think I know very much about baseball. Down in Fort Myers  in spring training I talked to pitchers, all of them, and Don  Schultz in particular, about the non-enforcement of the balk rule,  and I explained in detail, both in language and in physical  demonstration about ""coming set"" and the ""slow movement"", etc.  I explained that a pitcher did not have to come set; that he could  pitch when he started into the slow movement or at anytime during  the slow movement, or that he could continue the slow movement  until he did come set; that when he did come set, he should  frequently throw to catch the runner from the set position.    Tonight Don came set on every pitch. In the first inning, with  McCarthy the Greensboro center fielder on first base, with one man  out, Don came set and held it. McCarthy had such a lead and break  that catcher Flynn could not have shot him out with a high powered  rifle. Moreover, his arm movement from this set position gives  the base runner a lot of time for his break.    Schultz must be saying to himself, ""Well, the old man is a lot of  hot air. He doesn't know what he is talking about. I don't intend  to learn any kind of a move such as he has suggested. I am going  to be the old conventional type pitcher that lets the base runner  get all the lead and break he can.""    Then Don proceeded to give them the first run on a ball that was hit at  him, and which bounced off his arm and rolled back toward the catcher.  The catcher ran up to retrieve the ball and could have retired the  man at first, but he fumbled, and then the runner on second turns  third and goes for home. Catcher Flynn turns to toss the ball to  somebody or other, - the runner being half-way between third and home.  Flynn was 30' away and he has the ball. He got up, made a couple  of fake tosses, but nobody covered the home plate. Schultz was  standing a half a foot back of catcher Flynn. If he had covered  home plate, the man would have been out by 20'.    The umpire missed some of his best pitches, that is true, but when he  got into trouble he came with the fast ball, acting like a young,  18 year old, thinking evidently about throwing the ball by the  batsman instead of trying to think how to outsmart him. The result  was that they knocked Don around very badly."

He throws a change up on the curve ball but it has simply a bit less speed than his regular curve. It is not at all slow enough.

He has the only baseball scholarship at Athens. He neither drinks nor smokes and he has never had a girl. And I mean by that, he has never ""dated"". That might lead some reader of this memorandum to think that David goes in the direction of eunuchry. I don't think that at all. He is simply a country boy who doesn't find his school work too easy, having made ""C"" plus in his first two years at Ohio University and his mind is on a career in professional baseball. The boy wants to make everything subordinate to a baseball career.    He could make good right now in a B League, - provided he doesn't go through the not unusual course of frustration.

I don't think he can hold runners on at all. A base runner on first could easily take a 15' lead and take all kinds of a gambling break. In the second inning of the game, Witt acted like a boy who had never pitched before in his life.    Witt has no control of his change up on his fast ball.

Cholly Naranjo is the best major league  pitcher I have seen in the minors in a long time. If properly  pitched, he could win anywhere. He has a three-quarter, sweeping,   fairly fast velocity curve ball, and it is very effective. He uses  it very seldom. He does throw and so-called regular curve and one  that is a slow curve and both are good but there come times when  his fast curve, not really a great breaking ball, should be used.   His change up on the fast ball is invariably effective. Cholly   does not have a great fast ball, not great, but it is not a softy.   Because of good curves and his frequent use of them, the batter   is set up constantly to expect curves. His fast ball is usable.   Naranjo is intelligent, is a good competitor, and not a silly set   up at the plate like Raydon.     Within one year, Naranjo could become a regular starter   in the major leagues. Bragan got rid of him a year ago, thought   he was no good. In my judgment, he was the best pitcher on his   staff at that very time.     Arroyo, in my book, is just a so so pitcher. I may be   wrong about it, but Bragan and the coaches could set me right about   it. If I am right [about it], and further if waivers can be secured   on Arroyo, then he should be sent to Hollywood in the Naranjo deal.     If I am right about Naranjo, it would be a great thing   if he was with us the balance of the season. The future greatness   of the Pittsburgh pitching staff depends very much, it seems to me,   upon Dick Hall.

He must hit the ball  back at the pitcher, - deliberately try to do that  very thing on every strike pitch. He may lose some   power but sooner or later his form will change and then  he can forget all about this thing I call 'hitting with  intent.' If Powers has sense enough to follow this  instruction, he might help this club right now, - that  is to say, during the coming season.

He told me is working on a 'change up' off his fast ball. Seems to me to be the type that will learn from practice and instruction.    This boy should not be sent too high in 1963. He needs to be pitched a lot of innings, and where results will give him confidence.    BRANCH RICKEY"

These prospective  outfielders in this so-called instructional camp should  practice this throw in every pre-game workout.  They need not press to put more velocity on the ball.  Everyone knows that their arm is strong enough.  What everyone of them needs is correctness in the  throw itself, having in mind above everything else  that the relay man is given a choice on every throw.    All throws from outfielders in the pre-game  practice should have in mind the relay man and indeed  it would be well if in these pre-game practices that  a relay man would be placed for all outfield throws  to the home plate.

The location could be  anywhere, probably Homestead, - and without any necessary  publicity. Golf gloves must be available to these  boys, and practice periods of two hours forenoon and  afternoon. Only two employees are necessary and these  can be no older or better than the school boys, - ""shaggers""  indeed, one of whom could and would operate the pitching  machine. The players themselves would understand the  operation of the machine after the first day.    Each boy should be provided with approximately  a dozen bats of his chosen model. A proper coach  should be assigned to take charge of this fifteen day  workout with proper seating behind the net and would  become the consulting umpire. This practice is  calculated not only to make the change-over swing  become easy and natural but the additional benefit of  close and more accurate determination of the strike zone,  beneficial indeed to all players.

A   vigorous physically excellent father left the mother   with five sons and four daughters some years ago.   Gary is fourth from the top. The youngest is now a   junior in high school and a very great athlete; an   exceptional runner, a strong arm, - plays all sports.   This boy should be followed closely but discreetly   by Cardinal scouts and it could not hurt if Gary was   so regarded by the Cardinal brass that it would become   quick for this youngest brother to go nowhere other   than with the Cardinals.    Gary's next younger brother is in the army and   will not get out for two more years. The Cardinals   are interested in this boy, but the White Sox seem to   have developed the inside track and they have all but   signed him to a Chicago contract, - as an infielder.   It is a long story about his negotiation for a career   in baseball. The boy will be 23 when he gets out of the   army. He should have the attention of our scouting   staff also.    Gary met his wife Georgia when he played in the   Eastern League at Lancaster, Pa. Georgia is a   Lancaster girl and an only child and the father works   for the Hamilton Watch Company in Lancaster, Pa.   Georgia's mother is self-employed.    There are only two of the Kolb children   remaining with the mother, - a sister and the younger   brother referred to above. An 18 year old sister   lives in the same small town of Rock Falls, Illinois,   as does the mother, but lives with other girls elsewhere.   Fairly obviously there are some sad tag ends to the   overall Kolb family story.    All the facts, properly assembled, together with   acquaintanceship with Gary, leads one very firmly to   believe that he is a serious minded youngster with   fairly mature judgment in all directions, (his mother,   the family, his wife and four months old baby, and   particularly his baseball career).

This boy  could come to feel that he is a member of the team,  belongs, full of confidence that he can play with  poise and efficiency whenever called upon and at  practically any position.    Finally, I make this positive recommendation:    KOLB, CLEMENS, AND OLVER should have two  weeks of change-over practice at bat with two pitching  machines, (two because in the event one machine breaks  down there would be no lost time) with a properly  installed batting cage. The location could be  anywhere, probably Homestead, - and without any necessary  publicity. Golf gloves must be available to these  boys, and practice periods of two hours forenoon and  afternoon. Only two employees are necessary and these  can be no older or better than the school boys, - ""shaggers""  indeed, one of whom could and would operate the pitching  machine. The players themselves would understand the  operation of the machine after the first day.    Each boy should be provided with approximately  a dozen bats of his chosen model. A proper coach  should be assigned to take charge of this fifteen day  workout with proper seating behind the net and would  become the consulting umpire. This practice is  calculated not only to make the change-over swing  become easy and natural but the additional benefit of  close and more accurate determination of the strike zone,  beneficial indeed to all players.

The object of all of us, of course, is to   bring the St. Louis club, at the earliest possible   date, to a contending position for the pennant.    If upon further consideration additional players   should be exposed to this suggested practice, it must   be kept in mind that more than three batsmen to a cage   is ill-advised and if less than three to a cage, they   tire; the just couldn't take it.    The details of the practice should be self-observed  by the three players. At approximately the   12' mark from the batter, there should be a red tape   hanging vertically from top to bottom on each 50'   side netting (indicating fair from foul). And each   batsman's time at the plate should extend no longer   than three fair balls. He can take as many pitches   as he wishes which will include foul balls or missed   balls or bad pitches but does [not] include all balls   that clear the net or hit beyond the red tape on the   nets. Thus, the batsman at no time wearies because   of his length of stay and the two successive batsmen   outside the cage do not suffer ennui or impatience.    It is not necessarily incumbent that these   three batters, one or all, should stay with the change-over   position. It may be that the coach and the   batsman will agree (and it so sometimes happens) that   the batsman should stay with his original position   exclusively, in which case he will continue to define   the strike zone and even practice the technique of   hitting to the opposite field. This requires   knowledge on the part of the coach to instruct in that   technique.

During this course of wildness, he threw three curve balls. At least three times he shook his head on Oliver's call, - then threw the fast ball. In other words, when Broglio gets into trouble, it is quite evident that he goes to his fast pitch, and apparently nothing can stop him. This fellow surely has to come to know that his chance to be a great major league pitcher depends upon his curve ball. When in trouble, he should go to his curve ball and stay with it. Let the fast ball be his occasional pitch. I do not mean to say that Broglio's fast ball is not fast. It is, but I believe he over-pitches it and I don't believe he has as good control of it as his curve.     I urgently suggest that the manager should control Broglio's pitching.     Broglio can shake off the catcher once, and twice, but when the same signal is repeated it must control, - because the third repeat signal simply means that the manager is calling the pitch.     B[ ]glio cannot hold any good base runner on first base.

His appearance in the batting case (done at   my request) has indeed confirmed my belief that the boy   has good power, - also that he knows the strike zone   better than most.     Lewis needs acquaintanceship; at homeness;   orientation; a self estimate of existence.    Management has said that when you want Lewis   you have to look for him. Of course you do and until   the time comes when this boy really thinks that he   ""belongs"", - is worthwhile, until that time you will   always have to look for him when you want him. He is   not too far removed from the aegis of a slave-Negro.   In my judgement, he should have been given a lot of front   line work, played in games until we had reason either to   hire or fire him. We don't have any reason for any   decision on this player. Nobody knows.    BRANCH RICKEY"

It is usable if he has control. I believe he can get, without too much time, a change up on the curve ball. Aptitude is medium. Desire is good.    He has never tried a slider. Has never tried a knuckle ball. He should try both.    He must get a usable third pitch.    Not a candidate for the Instruction Camp this fall. His challenge is simply in the field of control.    His finger manipulation is perfect. Angle of delivery and finger placement repeat.    In Tom's case, it is a matter of intent and concentration. His physical set up should give him control. He must become a spot pitcher.    Right now, nobody can tell [you] how far he can go or whether he could go or not.    This boy is late starting on intensive work in getting any control but it is my judgment that he has to start right there.    He has an experience of a sore arm on the point of the shoulder, probably due to over pitching or perhaps press pitching or to the change in the angle of delivery. Right now his delivery is free and smooth and his step and follow through satisfactory. I know of no reason why the boy cannot come to be a control pitcher. If he has a recurring ailment on the shoulder, he should baby it, - stop short of pain always. I don't know this boy's future. I don't think anybody knows.    BRANCH RICKEY    cc - Mr. Bing Devine"

I mean it has deceptive velocity with identical fast ball delivery. Millikan agrees with me that his change up is an effective pitch, but that he seldom gets it over. This would explain why he seldom uses it. In other words, he doesn't have a usable third pitch.    I have said on several occasions that Sadecki had a great move to first base. Well, he does have if he would use it. He raises his left leg with a very slight pause in pitching to the plate. If with that same pause, he would throw to first, he would catch many men off and no one could get a break. However, I now observe that when he does throw to first base, he raises the leg in a complete 'tip=off' and the runner is standing on first base when Sadecki throws the ball. In other words, when Sadecki intends to throw to first, he actually telegraphs it well ahead of time.    He must throw to first base of the same left leg move that he makes when he pitches home, otherwise the base runner acquainted with the facts of Sadecki's delivery, as I have outlined above, Sadecki would be easier to steal on that Broglio or any other pitcher on the Cardinal club.    BRANCH RICKEY"

One is   a curve ball the same as any left hander has. Just a   curve ball and he can throw that curve ball with better   control than any other pitch he has including the fast   ball. He will also throw it when he in the hole or   indeed anytime he thinks the batsman is taking the pitch.    He then throws a looping change of pace curve, a   roly-poly trajectory that throws power hitters out of   gear.    Then he throws his strike out curve, - some speed   on it and a very quick break. He uses it on right   hand hitters and to strike out left handers.    It may be that Shantz's showing this spring is   a streak performance out of line with his recent records.   It is hard for me to understand how any club needing a   reserve pitcher would be willing to let him go. Even   if I believe that the Cardinal club would not be a pennant   contender before 1965, I would hold Shantz.

At the time   the ball leaves the pitcher's hand, Bill's bat is in a   positive perpendicular position. His hands are in   front of his left shoulder and of course in order to   get the power which he really has, he must go back   with his hands and particularly with the big end of the   bat. That doubles his problem in timing because he   is going in two directions, - backward and then forward.   His bat position should be such that the big end of the   bat is at the farthest point back of him at the time   the pitch starts. And it should be very quiet so that   a coin paced on the end of the bat would not fall off   until the forward motion starts.    A moving picture of Bill's batting stance   would show exactly what I mean. If he will simply   flex his wrists even though his hands are in front of   his shoulder, it would help surely about striking out.   And if his hands were back of his shoulder, then surely   his power would be increased.    I know of only one or two great batsmen who  have what I call this preliminary batting fault. Jackie  Robinson had it but he corrected it very largely by  pushing his hands out away from his body and placing  them well back of his shoulder.

He can't help anybody win a pennant on a   major league club. He is a liability; never an asset.    If the Cardinal club can get anything at all,   it should take it. Otherwise, he should have his   unconditional release. It would be better to give   somebody $46,000 to take over his present contract than   it would to keep him. The liability is not confined   simply to $46,000 (his salary). The real liability is   seeing him in any intelligent effort to win.      BRANCH RICKEY"

He is negative in every way. He has size, youth, and physical qualifications. He professes faith and confidence in his future, however in a very quiet and subdued manner. He can run fast enough but I doubt very much if he would ever elect to steal a base. He can throw with great velocity but regularly his throw indicates a desire for distance. Almost every throw from the outfield shows high trajectory. I have never seen either in practice or in a game any throw from him that could be cut off by the relay man. He is a good outfielder.    He has power at the plate but he is continuously fooled, confused, bewildered by varying pitches. It is my judgment that he is a .260 hitter and only that with Jacksonville or anywhere else. I seriously doubt if the boy will ever become a regular major league player in any position. He confesses quite candidly that he feels that his weakness is against right hand pitching; states that he has great confidence against left handers; feels that he can play first base even better than the outfield. The right hander's breaking stuff wrecks him.    This boy should go to Hollywood and hit in the cages as much as three hours every day, accompanied by two other batsmen. (An ample number of batsmen's gloves should be in Hollywood on opening date). It is possible that shifting this boy to left hand hitting against right hand pitching would make a different player out of him. He should be fully exposed to that experiment.    There is no aggressiveness in him. There is no ""come on boys, let's beat them"" in his system. He is a clean thinking and clean living fellow, - a native of Columbia, Missouri and has a full senior year's work ahead of him in order to get his university"

He is an amateur   on the pitcher's mound, a perfect neophyte in the art of pitching.   He doesn't know much but he has a lot of stuff. He is a major   league prospect. However, he should be left at Jacksonville where   it is to be hoped that he will pitch regularly.        BRANCH RICKEY      cc - Mr. Robert Howsam"

When Duke was turned over from a lefthander  to a righthander, he missed the first 11 good pitches and hit the 12th  and missed the next 6 -- and I mean he missed them.

In the first place, he has a lot of stuff - a fast ball, a curve, a change up on the fast ball, etc. He needs control of the curve ball before he ever pitches in very high company. It is not controlled at the present time. He just throws a curve.    The biggest problem with this boy is holding men on base. To begin with, he dangles his right leg. He puts no weight on it. In the second place, he has a slow movement of his lower limb and the knee comes very slowly up and around. Then when the knee starts forward, he starts his pitch with his arm. By that time, the man has stolen second base. Of course, my description sounds worse and is worse than the actual performance, but the exaggeration simply emphasizes the boy's biggest problem in becoming a pitcher.    First of all, he must put weight on his right leg in taking his pitching position with a man on first and he must put enough weight on that leg that he cannot take the long, slow sweep with his right knee. This weight balancing process might correct somewhat the fault but I don't believe it will cure him altogether. The boy is inclined by habit surely to move the knee up and back and around very slowly, permitting the runner to break. If he were to hold the knee in a short stop in the course of his delivery and go either to first or home with it, he could retain that slow movement and I believe that this is the procedure for him to follow. It will take some time for him to perfect any delivery to hold men on. He has good stuff and has a lot of patience. He should be pitched a lot before next October 1st. Daniel will probably lose most of the games he plays in this instruction league. I think it will take a long time for him to become a major league pitcher. He has so much to learn.    BRANCH RICKEY"

How Taylor and Hughes and Fanok or indeed anybody can watch Koufax constantly pitch the changes of speed and not understand that they too could pitch effectively with their own changes of speed pitches is beyond me. Broglio and Shantz do pitch, for example, the slow curve frequently (Broglio not enough however), - but Fanok and Taylor could almost instantly be really great pitchers if they would use the curve ball more. This boy comes the nearest to perfection in pitching of anyone in either major league at the present time. He has more speed than Spahn and almost perfect control of a slow curve, - that really curves. He also has an exceptional fast ball and occasionally throws a change up off the fast ball. He has four pitches, - four different pitches and the best thing about Koufax that really makes him a great pitcher is the fact that he uses all four, - three of them constantly. There are several pitchers in the league and several on our club who have an assortment of pitches but they seldom use more than two, viz, the curve and fast ball.    This fellow has so much stuff and has such perfect control that I am almost compelled to believe that the way to beat him is to let everybody hit every cripple even to the point where our extra base hitters would hit with three and none. Koufax is not likely to walk anybody and men like James and White could, on occasion, be permitted to hit even three and none with nobody on the bases.

The opposing pitcher, filled with obvious venom after a damaging homerun, threw at Jose, - also Chasteen. The next time at bat, Jose bunted and the pitcher fielding the bunt roughly tagged [at] Jose en route to first base. Jose was carrying the bat with him and quite deliberately struck the pitcher with the bat a second time in the midriff and laid the pitcher out. Arrest followed and jail, - a fine and a probational jail sentence. After that affair, the player went from .390 in the next dozen games to .360, making only one hit in the next nineteen times at bat.    With Jacksonville, he finished the season with about a .270 average.    This experience may have changed his batting position at the plate.

He has great power with little effort, - more power, I believe, than Chasteen, - more than Laboy. This fellow would not pitch another game for me at Sarasota. He has a good arm and he can throw the ball very hard. He would play the outfield until I was very sure from my own personal observation that he could not become a good outfielder. I don't know about his running. I saw him run from home to first twice. He looked below average and he is probably below average. I don't know whether he can catch a fly ball or not but we ought to find out about it. We do not have anybody in the entire organization who hits better form or more power than Sinnott. He may not be able to hit breaking stuff at the present but he would certainly get the chance from me to learn to hit breaking stuff.    I talked to Fred Keonig before the game today about playing this fellow in the outfield. It was admitted be everybody, I thought, that Palmer, for example, was not a major league prospective outfielder, yet Palmer played the entire nine innings and Sinnott didn't even appear as a pinch hitter in a game that was lost up until the eighth inning.    This Sinnott gives me the chance to say a word on camp management. There should be a policy at Sarasota or indeed everywhere on our minor league clubs to bring every boy to his potential. I have seen an 18 year old high school boy who thought he was and everybody considered him to be a catcher. He went to the major league as a shortstop. I am sure I can cite fifty notable cases where young pitcher have become regular major league players in some other position. The school days of Roderick Wallace, Hal Chase, George Moriarity, Cy Seymour and many others of that era and later such notables as Babe Ruth, George Sisler, Pepper Martin, Chick Hafey, Lefty O'Doul and many others of"

He should be given a quick and thorough trial. There isn't any question about his power hitting ability or about his batting form. He tears the cover off the ball with an apparently easy normal swing. There may be great potential in this fellow but we don't know anything about it. Any manager who is not awake and alive and anxious to find out and develop the possibilities of players in all directions should not be one of our minor league managers. Let him do something else.    For sixty years I have been directing one or more baseball clubs in one field or classification or another and in those sixty years I have never directed a subordinate by commands. I have followed closely the policy of suggestion, - a sort of platonic approach to a policy and I have had conformity to the suggestion process, - almost without exception over those years. If management is not disposed to adopt a suggested move, I have found it necessary, in case of opposition, to get rid of him; in case of complacent inaction or lethargic conformance, I would demote him. Usually in that event conversation and explanation followed. The manager would be restored to his job but never again would he fail to follow a positive suggestion. That is exactly the way I would handle Mr. Fred Koenig. (For instance, I think Fred Koenig is a close observer of players and a good judge of talent but with no imagination whatever).    The same criticism applies in the case of John Van at Rock Hill. I don't know that John Van can be an outfielder. Likewise, I don't know that he can't become an outfielder but I do know that his ability in some directions [that] fully warrants our finding out right now the facts about his outfielding potential. It is slothful and unthinking [managers to be comatose when facing the development of young players."

Perfect form at the plate, and a lot of  power. Should be able to hit any kind of pitching. Both Joe Brown and  Rip Sewell tell me he is a good fellow on the club, - a team player, wants  to win. Runs in and out from his position all the time, and his interest  is just not put on. I think he really means it. I have never seen him  throw the ball low enough to any base or the home plate. He is an ""Andy-  Over"" thrower, yet his arm is strong. If he would throw the ball down,   he might then be accurate with it. Sewell says he is accurate, but he has  never shown accuracy to me. He is a distance thrower. Can run good  enough, and he never loafs. I like his potentialities.    He, too, is not daring. He assumes, for example, that the outfielder  is going to get the ball, and he doesn't overrun the base as far  as he should. There are a lot of things he doesn't know. He could stand  a lot of correct coaching; illustrustion: When running off third base  with a runner on first, - every time the pitcher threw to first, he started  back to third. He should, with great daring, start for home. If a wild   throw is made to first, or missed, he could easily score, but he is back on  the bag. In other words, he moves exactly in the wrong direction on this  play. He shifts very short distances on the different batters. This   may be due first to lack of knowledge of the hitters, or, second, it can be  that the opposing team, in the few games I have observed, all hit to the same  spot.    ""Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth."", and great players whom  management would like to see in Pittsburgh are to be found fault with if  they are not as good as they should be.    And, finally, one more possible criticism. With the score  nothing to nothing, and a runner in scoring distance, he fails to take a  chance. On a short fly ball that he could have caught, I am sure, if he  had made a dive, he failed to do so. He, too, may not have championship  adventure in his soul. I do not know about it.    If this team had a couple of ace pitchers, they could make a big  stir in the Southern League race, and easily go into the play-offs, and  that is my fault.

He is a bigger, stronger pitcher than most pitchers you will see in high schools anywhere.   On a first look, he is more impressive than Briles.   Mr. Blight told me that his boy had never thrown the curve ball ""prior today"". That was amazing to me until Gene DeSautel told me that the boy just learned the curve ball this present season under his (DeSautel's) tutelage. His curve is now and then a corking curve, - good velocity and a quick break. Jim is bound to go places in the major leagues, and is worth a competitive bonus figure if there is any way to retain him. That's the problem and that's the challenge to our policy of signing first year men.   He lost his game in this championship contest, - losing to Midland 6 to 5, - horrible support.

This is a tragic case of a fine physical specimen and a most likable person failing as a major league player.  He has had 5 full years in professional baseball and he is now 25 years of age, and he has always hit left handed and has always hit from the same batting box position. His rear foot -- the left one -- the toe of his left foot is 28"" from a line drawn at right angles to this plate position. He could not reach the outside of the plate with both hands on the bat and yet he has held that position for 5 full years.  Last year he hit .243 at Jacksonville. He is a power hitter -- plenty of power particularly, of course, to the right field, but he hits the long ball to left also.  He shows no aptitude whatever to the suggestions made by Manager Keane or Vernon Benson or anyone else.  To draw a comparison, when Buchek was turned from a righthand hitter to a lefthand hitter -- on the first 12 pitches he made contact upon every pitch and contunued to get the bat and ball together almost without exception. When Duke was turned over from a lefthander to a righthander, he missed the first 11 good pitches and hit the 12th and missed the next 6 -- and I mean he missed them. He was not swinging hard. He was instructed to just simply get the bat and ball together as though he were in a pepper game. He simply could not hit the ball at all.  He did better hitting left handed when told to hit with ""intent"" meaning pulling or pushing the ball but not at all to compare with either Gagliano or Buchek.  -more-"

It could be true that he has been so disadvantaged for 5 years in playing the outside pitching that when the ball comes inside he has consistently either taken the pitch and perhaps a called strike, or has hit it on the handle and this causes him to be unable to handle the inside pitch.  He frequently misses it altogether.  He is married and has several children -- comes from an economically low family on the other side of the tracks in Brooklyn. Married to a very charming and lovable wife. Knows nothing except baseball and would give his soul to make good.  He has the sympathy of his manager and coaches and he certainly has mine.  I am simply non-plussed as to how to help this fellow.  At the present time, he should be kept at the pitching machines constantly.  Manager Keane tells me that we do not have at present any acceptable substitution at first base; that Duke Carmel can do the fielding job splendidly; that is, his arm is very good and his running speed very good.  A left hand pinch hitter is highly desirable on a Cardinal Club and Duke's power to right field makes the right field roof as easily reached by Duke as most boys make singles.  It is sorrowfully tragic to have him fail, but he certainly cannot help this club as a batsman with his present rating.  I hope that in three or four weeks from now I can write a different story."
